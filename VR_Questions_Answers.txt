Answers to VR Interaction Lab Questions

1. What is gaze-based interaction?
Gaze-based interaction is an input method in Virtual Reality (VR) where the user's head orientation (or eye tracking) controls a cursor or reticle. It allows users to interact with the virtual environment simply by looking at objects. Selections are typically triggered by a secondary action, such as a physical button press or, more commonly, a "dwell" mechanic where the user holds their gaze on a target for a specific duration.

2. Why is dwell time useful?
Dwell time is crucial for preventing the "Midas Touch" problem—interaction designs where users accidentally select or activate everything they look at. By requiring a user to sustain their gaze for a set period (e.g., 2 seconds) before an action triggers, the system can distinguish between casual observation (looking around) and intentional interaction (trying to select something). It confirms user intent.

3. How does sensory feedback improve realism?
Sensory feedback (visual, auditory, and haptic) bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds. In real life, every action has a reaction: flipping a switch makes a click sound and provides tactile resistance. In VR, providing immediate feedback (like a sound effect, a color change, or a controller vibration) confirms to the user that their action was registered. this multi-sensory confirmation reduces cognitive load and increases "presence"—the feeling of actually being inside the virtual environment.

4. Which cube felt most immersive and why?
The cube using the "GazeInteraction" script (which included Audio and Scaling) felt the most immersive.
Reasoning:
- Multimodal Feedback: Unlike the other cubes that only acted visually (ColorCube only changed color; OnlyScale only changed size), this cube provided a combination of Visual (color change + scaling) and Auditory (bell sound) feedback.
- Confirmation: The sound effect provided a clear, distinct confirmation of the completed action, which is more satisfying and reliable than visual cues alone.
- Agency: The combination of dwell time with a distinct audio-visual reward made the interaction feel deliberate and impactful, mimicking the cause-and-effect nature of real-world interactions.
